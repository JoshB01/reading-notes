## Wireframing

Wireframing is the process UX designers use to plan the design of a website. It is done in black and white and allows for the designr to see how a user would interact with a website before adding the final touches.

Wireframes can be drafted by hand or made completely with software with programs like Invision, or Balsamiq. However the pen and paper approach allows for easier and cheaper changes to be made. The ultimate goal is to create an enjoyable user experience that's intuitive to all site visitors and that requires following a couple steps:

#### 1. Do your research
- understand your audience
- detail any requirements
- analyze similar product lines

#### 2. Prepare your research for quick reference
- don't struggle to retain the information
- write down important research and key features

#### 3. have your user flow mapped out
- avoid messy wireframing
- know where your users are coming from and where you want them to end up
- a good user flow will make for self sufficient users

#### 4. Draft, don’t draw. sketch, don’t illustrate
- outline the basic format but don't add all the details
- build the skeleton
- verify ideas with partners

#### 5. Details and testing
- add informational details
- think about usability, simple instructions and tool tips to help visitors
- test and collect feedback

#### 6. Prototype
- start prototyping with tools like Proto.io to Adobe XD and Framer
- this crosses the stage from wireframing to prototyping 

## HTML 

The code used to structure a web page and it's content whether it be paragraphs or a bulleted list. HTML is a markup language and consists of elements that you use to wrap different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. This "wrap" is made up of an opening and closing tag that surround the content. The content, opening and closing tag altogether make up the element.

Elements can have attributes. These contain extra infromation about the element that you don't want in the actual content, and should always have the following:

1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

Nesting elements are elements within other elements
Empty elements have no content
