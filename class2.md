## Text Editor

A text editor is a piece of software you use to write and manage text that you write to build a website. They can be downloaded onto your computer or just used online. There are a couple things to look out for when finding a good text editor;

1. Code Completion: this feature allows you to begin typing and suggestions will appear to improve and speed up work flow
2. Syntax Highlighting: this colorizes the text you tyoe making certain portions more noticeable, and lessening srain on the eyes
3. Extensioins: these are essentially plugins for your text editor and allow you to add extra functionality as you see fit

## Text Editors and IDEs

While a text editor edits and manages text, IDE's /(Integrated Development Environment) are multiple software systems put together, so a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one. It's personal preference what you chose to use but text editors are more than enough when just starting out.

## The Command Line

The command line also known as the terminal is a text based interface to the system that can be given commands and will be given feedback.
Within the terminal is the shell, this part of the operating system determines how the terminal will act and is what run commands. The most common shell is called **bash** or Bourne again shell.

## Navigating the Terminal

There are numerous commands you can use to move around the system, a few of the basics and their functions include;

- pwd: tells you what your current or working directory is
- ls: tells you what is in your current working directory
- ~: a shortcut to your home directory
- .: this is a reference to your current directory
- ..: this is a reference to the parent directory

## Files

One thig to keep in mind is that everything is a file form your keyboard to an actual text file.

### Linus 

In most systems the extension on a file is very important in determing how the system treats it, however Linux ignores the actual extension and looks at the actual file to determine what type it is.
Linux is also case sensitive, so it's important to be accurate in file names.
