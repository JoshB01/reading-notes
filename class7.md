## Functions

A block of code designed to perform a specific task that us executed when invoked. Functions are defined by the keyword function followed by a name and parenthes and curly brackets. Parameters live within the parentheses while the code to be executed lives in the curly brackets.

Function arguments are the values recieved when a function is invoked. There are three kinds of invocation: 

- When an event occurs
- When it is invoked from JS code
- Automatically

You can reuse functions with different arguments after they've been defined only once
