# Class 6

## JavaScript

A lightweight, interpreted, compiled programming language with first class function or functions treated like any other variable. Allows for interaction between the client and the site, and the site and the server.

JavaScripts contains a library of objects and a core set of language elements such as operators and control structures.

JavaScrips borrows most of it's syntax from Java, C and C++ but it's also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python. and it is case sensitive. Instructions are called statements and much like CSS are seperated by semicolons.

JavaScrips has 3 kinds of variable declarations:

- var: declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value
- let: declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value
- const: declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant

## Variables

Are used as symbolic names (identifiers) for values in your application. A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_) or a dollar sign.

## Data Types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

Seven data types that are primitives:

- Boolean: true and false.
- null: A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
- undefined: A top-level property whose value is not defined.
- Number: An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
- BigInt: An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
- String: A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
- Symbol: A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.

- Object: named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your script can perform

## Literals

Represent values in JavaScript- fixed values not variable:

- Array: is a list of zero or more expressions each of which represents an array element enclosed in squre brakets (let coffees = ['French Roast', 'Colombian', 'Kona'];)
- Boolean: has two literal values: true and false
- Numeric: nclude integer literals in different bases as well as floating-point literals in base-10
- Object: a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces
- RegExp: a pattern enclosed between slashes. The following is an example of a regex literal
- String: zero or more characters enclosed in double (") or single (') quotation marks. A string must be delimited by quotation marks of the same type
