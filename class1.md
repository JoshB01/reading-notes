## Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset is essentially believing in one's own ability to, well, grow. Someone with this ideal needs perseverance and the ability to take advantage of their resources to achieve their potential in whatever field they pursue. Three ways I remind myself to stay in a growth mindset are:

1. Remembering that everyone learns at a different pace, so frustration from feeling left behind doesn't bother me
2. Telling myself that the challenging things are worth doing because they come with the greatest reward
3. Remembering to tell myself ***yet;*** everyting comes in time and learning takes practice to make perfection

## What I've Learned

GitHub allows the user to build a website in a streamlined and simplistic manner. With GitHub Pages you can turn GitHub repositories into legible websites for anyone to access. GitHub Pages makes it easy to customize the parameters of your website including headings, text styles etc. For example if you wanted to italicize a word to really emphasize it's importance you would only need to add \* to both sides of the word or phrase like this: *example.*

The system we use to make these changes to our GitHub websites is called Markdown, and it's the same system that allowed me to insert that link in the page above this paragraph.
