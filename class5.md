## CSS 

CSS or (Cascading Style Sheets) allows the user to create the look of their webpage. Without CSS all webpages would be a little uninteresting to look at.

CSS specifies how documents are presented to the end user and it can be used from anything from basic text styling to animation. CSS is rules based and rule definitions are specified by groups of styles that should be applied to elements on your webpage.

Start with the selector, this tells CSS the HTML element we want to style, then add { }, and inside make declarations, for example;

h2 {
    color: green;
    font-size: 3em;
}

## Adding CSS

There are three ways to insert CSS:

- External: external style sheet can change the enitre page with one file added to the head section of your HTML page, and must be saved with a .css extension
- Internal: is used if a single HTML page has a unique style and is defined inside the style element inside the head section
- Inline: is used to apply uniqe style for a single element directly to the actual element
